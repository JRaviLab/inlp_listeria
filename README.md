## Abstract
_Listeria monocytogenes_ (_Lm_) is a bacterial pathogen that causes listeriosis in immunocompromised individuals, particularly pregnant women. Several virulence factors support the intracellular lifecycle of _Lm_ and facilitate cell-to-cell spread, allowing it to occupy multiple niches within the host and cross protective barriers, including the placenta. One family of virulence factors, internalins, contributes to _Lm_ pathogenicity by inducing specific uptake and conferring tissue tropism. Over 25 internalins have been identified thus far, but only a few have been extensively studied. Internalins contain leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains which enable protein-protein interactions, allowing _Lm_ to bind host proteins. Notably, other _Listeria_ species express internalins but cannot colonize human hosts, prompting questions regarding the evolution of internalins within the genus _Listeria_. Internalin P (InlP) promotes placental colonization through interaction with the host protein afadin. Though prior studies of InlP have begun to elucidate its role in _Lm_ pathogenesis, there remains a lack of information regarding homologs in other _Listeria_ species. Here, we have used a computational evolutionary approach to identify InlP homologs in additional _Listeria_ species. We found that _L. ivanovii londoniensis_ (_Liv_) and _L. seeligeri_ (_Ls_) encode InlP homologs. We also found InlP-like homologs in _L. innocua_ and the recently identified species _L. costaricensis_. All newly identified homologs lack the full-length LRR6 and LRR7 domains found in _Lm_â€™s InlP. These findings inform on the evolution of one key _Lm_ virulence factor, InlP, and serve as a springboard for future evolutionary studies of _Lm_ pathogenesis as well as mechanistic studies of _Listeria_ internalins.
