## Abstract
_Listeria monocytogenes_ (_Lm_) is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes listeriosis in immunocompromised individuals, particularly pregnant women. Several virulence factors support the intracellular lifecycle of Lm and facilitate cell-to-cell spread, allowing it to occupy multiple niches within the human host and cross- protective barriers, including the placenta. One family of virulence factors, internalins, contributes to Lm pathogenicity by inducing specific uptake and conferring tissue tropism. Over 25 internalins have been identified thus far, but only a few have been extensively studied. Internalins contain leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains which enable protein-protein interactions, allowing Lm to bind host proteins. Notably, other Listeria species express internalins but cannot colonize human hosts, prompting questions regarding the evolution of internalins within the genus Listeria. Internalin P (InlP) promotes placental colonization through interaction with the host protein afadin. Though prior studies of InlP have begun to elucidate its role in Lm pathogenesis, there remains a lack of information regarding homologs in other Listeria species. Here, we have used a computational evolutionary approach to identify InlP homologs in additional Listeria species. We found that _L. ivanovii londoniensis_ (_Liv_) and _L. seeligeri_ (_Ls_), encode one and three InlP homologs, respectively. _Liv_ is pathogenic to livestock, while Ls is considered non-pathogenic; neither is implicated in human placental infection. We also found InlP-like homologs in _L. innocua_ and the recently identified species _L. costaricensis_. All newly identified homologs lack the full-length LRR6 and LRR7 domains found in Lmâ€™s InlP. These findings shed light on the evolution of one key _Lm_ virulence factor, InlP, and serve as a springboard for future evolutionary studies of _Lm_ pathogenesis as well as _in vitro_ mechanistic studies of Listeria internalins.
