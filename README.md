## Abstract
Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes listeriosis in immunocompromised individuals, particularly pregnant women. Several virulence factors support the intracellular lifecycle of Lm and facilitate cell-to-cell spread, allowing it to occupy multiple niches within the human host and cross- protective barriers, including the placenta. One family of virulence factors, internalins, contributes to Lm pathogenicity by facilitating allowing specific uptake and conferring tissue tropism. Over 25 internalins have been identified thus far, but only a few have been extensively studied. Internalins contain leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains which enable protein-protein interactions, allowing Lm to bind specific host proteins. Notably, other Listeria species express internalins but cannot colonize human hosts, prompting questions regarding the evolution of internalins within the genus Listeria. Internalin P (InlP) promotes placental colonization through interaction with the host protein afadin. Though pPrior studies of internalin P have focused onbegun to elucidate its role in Lm pathogenesis, there remains aand lack information regarding homologs in other Listeria species. Here, we report that at least two other Listeria species, L. ivanovii londoniensis (Li) and L. seeligeri (Ls), encode one and three InlP homologs, respectively. Li is pathogenic to livestock, while Ls is considered non-pathogenic; neither is implicated in human placental infection. All four newly identified homologs lack the full-length LRR6 and LRR7 domains found in Lmâ€™s InlP. These findings shed light on the evolution of one key Lm virulence factor, InlP, and serve as a springboard for future evolutionary studies of Lm pathogenesis as well as in vitro mechanistic studies of Listeria internalins.
